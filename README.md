<sup>1</sup> Requires [Xamarin Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Forms/)
<sup>2</sup> Requires [MR.Gestures](http://www.mrgestures.com) - Highly recommended library, first-class code and documentation, currently only 10 euros per license. (I'm not affiliated with them in anyway)
<sup>3/sup> Requires XamSvg, which used to cost $100 USD but has been raised to a exceedingly high $300. I want to get rid of this dependency, but its so helpful.
