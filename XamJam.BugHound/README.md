## ![](https://github.com/jasonCodesAway/XamJam/blob/master/XamJam.BugHound/icon.svg) Xamarin-compatible cross-platform logging and bug tracking framework.

#### Disclaimer
This is largely untested and this is intentionally lightweight (aka. feature-poor). I'm happy to accept pull requests for cleanly implemented features.

#### Setup
* Available on [NuGet Xam.Plugins.XamJam.BugHound](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugins.XamJam.BugHound)
* Install into your PCL project and Client/Platform projects. If you don't install it into your Client/Platform project a barebone platform-agnostic framework will still run.
