## ![](https://github.com/jasonCodesAway/XamJam/blob/master/XamJam.Wall/icon.png) Visual Wall that supports panning and selecting items. Typically used to show images.

#### Disclaimer
This is largely untested and this is intentionally lightweight (aka. feature-poor). I'm happy to accept pull requests for cleanly implemented features.

#### Setup
* This package requires [MR.Gestures](http://www.mrgestures.com/) and Xamarin.Forms
* Available on [NuGet Xam.Plugins.XamJam.Wall](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugins.XamJam.Wall)

#### Usage
```csharp
TODO
```
#### Related projects:
* This project could really use some help from anyone who understand XAML templates well. The WallView should accept a template in XAML that handles rendering, on-click bindings, etc. But I don't know how to do that.

#### Related documentation:
* TODO
